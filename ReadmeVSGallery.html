<p>It helps you to automate mocks creating in your unit tests.</p>
<p>Similar tasks can be solved by using&nbsp;Moq.AutoMocker but if you like to do it manually this tool helps you.</p>
<p>How to use it:</p>
<p>In the <strong>TestInitialize</strong> marked method create the instance of your Service under the test (sut).</p>
<p>After that you can see code analysis error and the next suggestions (lightbulbs):</p>
<ul>
<li>to create a constructor without parameters </li>
<li>to make mock </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Choose "<strong>Make mock</strong>" - it will create the mocks required for your service and put them into constructor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Create <strong>TestMethod </strong>marked method and write here a call of any methods of your sut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If sut's method uses any of injected instances Visual Studio shows your code analysis info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Choose "<strong>Make mock</strong>" - it will setup the mock's methods and calls VerifyAll for each of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After that change all <strong>default(type)</strong> expressions to values you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Using a hotkeys: <strong>F8</strong> (Go to nex error-warning-info) or <strong> F12 </strong>with Resharper -&gt; <strong>Ctrl + .</strong> (Show potential fixes - <span>Smart Tags</span>&nbsp; menu) or <strong>Alt + Enter</strong> with Resharper&nbsp;-&gt; <strong>m&nbsp;</strong>(select "Make mock" in the menu) -&gt; <strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>This extension is currently compiled for VS Pro. I didn't find how to publish here an extension with type 'tool' for VS Community Edition. But it's available for downloading on the Github:&nbsp;<a title="MockIt for Community Edition" href="https://github.com/ycherkes/MockIt/blob/master/MockIt.vsix">https://github.com/ycherkes/MockIt/blob/master/MockIt.vsix</a></p>
<p>It's also available via NuGet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/MockIt/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/MockIt/</a></p>
